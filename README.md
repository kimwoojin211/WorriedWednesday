Repository: https://github.com/kimwoojin211/WorriedWednesday
<br>

Installation Instructions **Coming Soon**.

To Setup for debugging:

**Requirement**:
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that can run Xamarin.Forms 5.0. I recommend the free Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition. Please visit [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) to download Visual Studio 2019.
(The following instructions will be assuming you are using Visual Studio 2019. If you are using a different IDE, please follow their instructions on how to set up a testing simulation for mobile devices.)

* Download or clone the repository from the GitHub link provided above.
* (For those unfamiliar with Git or GitHub, follow the GitHub link, click the green "Code" button, press "Download Zip", download the folder onto your computer, and unzip the downloaded folder)
* Open "WorriedWednesday.sln" in your Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition
* If not previously installed, please see [Installation(Windows)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019) or [Installation(Mac)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/mac/installation?view=vsmac-2019)
* Ensure that your VS2019 is configured for Xamarin.  Visit [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/installation/) to install Xamarin on your respective OS.
* Follow the steps found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/get-started/installation/android-emulator/device-manager?tabs=macos&pivots=windows) to set up a virtual Android device for deubugging.
* If sucessful, you should now be able to run the Worried Wednesday Android program through the Android Emulator on your VS2019 Community Edition.

## Bugs as of 5/24
